          <p class="">
            My name is Ruby and I was raised and born in <em>Vancouver.</em> I
            am <strong> very allergic</strong> to cats but will disregard my
            allery to pet a cat. I am an animal lover but ironiclly don't have a pet. I would like to have a pet cat because of their funny personality. For instance, cats bop other cats head and pretend that they weren't the problem.

            <p class="dodge">I really enjoy being active and playing sports. I played
              volleyball and ultimate in highschool with some of my bestfriends. I played for a volleyball team outside of highschool and traveled all over canada to play. I made a lot of lifelong memories while traveling and want to continue to travel after I graduate. I
              applied to the Cit course because of my personal interest in
              computers.</p>
