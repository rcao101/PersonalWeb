            My name is Ruby and I was raised and born in <em>Vancouver.</em> I
            am <strong> very allergic</strong> to cats but will disregard my
            allery to pet a cat. I am an animal lover but ironiclly don't have a
<<<<<<< HEAD
            pet. I would like to have a pet cat because of their funny personality. For instance, cats bop other cats head and pretend that they weren't the problem.
          </p>

          <p>I really enjoy being active and playing sport. I played
            volleyball and ultimate in highschool with some of my bestfriends. I
            applied to the Cit course because of my personal interest in
            computers.</p>

            pet. My dream pet would be a cat. Cats are very funny especially when they bop other cats on the head and pretend that the problem wasn't them. Cats have their own personality that can really heal my own aura from a stressful day.</p>
